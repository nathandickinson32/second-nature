  <div>
    <p>Second nature logo and title</p>
    <p>user photo (default as just a profile picture head thing) and user's name displayed underneath</p>
    <p>Home button is already on App.vue with nav</p>
    <p>Notes dumping: router-view just shows the view that you're (App.vue)</p>
    <p>Include Header.vue in App.vue for it to be accessible everywhere in app (under nav ?)</p>
    <p>Keep Header.vue component file and just import into App.vue</p>
